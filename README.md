The dataset I am working with is a collection of Facebook pages from 10 Thai fashion and cosmetics retail sellers. It contains data on various types of posts—videos, photos, statuses, and links—across 7051 instances, with 11 features. The engagement metrics tracked include comments, shares, and reactions, which provide valuable insights into how audiences interact with different post types.
I obtained this dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is particularly interesting because it provides a real-world example of consumer behavior on social media platforms, which is essential for businesses aiming to optimize their digital marketing strategies. The dataset focuses on the engagement patterns of retail sellers in Thailand, offering a unique perspective on how businesses use Facebook Live, posts, and other content to engage their customers. This makes it especially relevant for analyzing the effectiveness of different types of content and understanding the factors driving engagement in the fashion and cosmetics sectors.
The dataset lends itself to clustering tasks, where the goal is to group similar types of posts based on engagement metrics. This can provide insights into what types of content attract the most engagement, and whether there are seasonal or time-based trends in consumer behavior.
Overall, this dataset is a rich resource for studying consumer engagement in a social media context and provides an opportunity to apply clustering and other data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and trends in digital marketing.
